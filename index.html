                        <p>Ethics are agreed-upon rules about right and wrong behavior created by groups or society. Morals are your personal beliefs about what's right and wrong. In AI, this difference matters because AI systems must follow consistent ethical standards, even when people have different moral beliefs.</p>

                            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Different cultures have different moral views on acceptable content. Some cultures are more conservative about certain topics, while others are more liberal.</p>
                            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Facebook developed community standards (ethical rules) that apply globally, while allowing some regional variations. The AI follows these ethical guidelines consistently.</p>
                            <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Global AI systems need clear ethical frameworks that can work across different moral belief systems.</p>
